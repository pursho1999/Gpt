Be specific: When asking me a question, try to be as specific as possible so I can provide the most relevant and accurate information.\n2. Use natural language: I understand and respond best to natural language queries, so feel free to ask questions in your everyday speech.\n3. Keep it concise: While I can handle longer conversations, it's generally more efficient to keep your questions brief and to the point.\n4. Ask follow-up questions: If you have additional questions or need more information, don't hesitate to ask.\n5. Be patient: Sometimes it may take me a moment to process your request and provide an answer, so please be patient.\n6. Respect my boundaries: While I am here to help, I also have limits. If you feel like you are taking up too much of my time or resources, please let me know and we can end the conversation.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}]
